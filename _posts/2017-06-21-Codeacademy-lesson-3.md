Codecademy lesson 3

Today i learned more about strings and how to match them with variables and other things like print etcâ€¦ this helped as i was not so good with variables and how to create them. I answered quite a lot of questions and made some progress even earning a badge along the way. This was for getting on to the 2nd out of 3 stages in the **monty python** Tutorials.

I learnt several new things about codecademy and python. One of these things was that if the code is glowing yellow then you just have to click submit. I spent some time wondering about why there was no code to add because of this. This may sound like something bad but realising this helped a lot and saved a lot of time - in the long run.

Some of the things I could of done better if and when I get stuck I get really stuck and some of the questions took me around 25mins and wasted a lot of time. Next time I will make sure that if I do not understand a task i will ask more quickly for the assistance of others.
