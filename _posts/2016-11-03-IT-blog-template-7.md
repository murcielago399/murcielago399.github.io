    <td>The strategies that were effective were just following the 'what will I do next time' things that have mainly followed and set over the past blog posts E.G take notes and acting onthings quicker/ completing instructions straight away I.E I note any homework down straight away. I have noticed that one of my blogs has gone missing so that may be why I have one less than everybody else, the reason that the numbers are right are because If you read my first few posts, as I said that I posted them late and noticed it then so before I posted them I numbered them correctly.


What i changed on my blogâ€¦

  <tr>
    <td>In the lesson I forgot to spell the each word out to My partner which last time I said I would !This resulted in time wasting because I would say a word and Adam would quickly come over to look at the sheet / book to see what the spelling was like and My partner would only glance he would only just briefly see it and even then he had seen it he would still sometimes spell it wrong. Another thing that limited my learning was getting distracted afterwards had completed page 45 it's asked you to guess the number that it was thinking of so we thought it would be funny to start answering back to the computer here are some examples...
