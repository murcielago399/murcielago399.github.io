Codeacademy lesson 1

We were first introduced to codecademy today and have been working our way through the tutorials. This will mean that we will be fully capable of coding things like games and websites by ourselves. We specifically used python which is a simple and easy to learn syntax coding system which can come in handy in later life!

I started off completing the basic tutorials and made my way quickly through them remembering to read, as I go along. Over time by completing 'stages' which is around 8 questions you would receive awards (badges) for completing tasks and for coding for ‘X’ amount of time. I made it up to around tutorial 6 on the 3rd stage. On the way the tutorials ranged from just clicking submit to figuring out what’s wrong with several lines of code. Now this may sound easy however finding out what’s wrong in the code can be very tricky as even one to many spaces or a comma in the wrong place could ruin the whole of what you have created.

A lot of things went well e.g worked very quickly however some things didn't go so well as i couldn’t remember my password and occasionally got very stuck because I didn’t quite read the question. I also made some silly mistakes with the spaces (putting them in when not needed) and to know when and when not to use the spaces or brackets had to use the hint.

Here are the badges I received:
