**IT Codecademy lesson 5**

In this lesson we did not use Python but Instead we Thought about Thinking for the lesson we first discussed Instructions about how to make tea;

* First get the pour water into the kettle.

* Next put the kettle on the hob.

* Press the button to boil the kettle.

We were then told to give more specific Instructions;

* Pour 150ml of water into the kettle …

We were told that a computer needs specific code and has no brain to know how much of amounts, This is called deposition . We also learned that when using PRINT "", it is basicly say shoe on screen the “”. 

We also talked about the restrictions of a small robot making a cup of tea how it's not like a human. If the tea is too far away than the robot can’t make it itn also has 1 arm and could not find a way to pick up the milk and kettle.

I managed to fix my blog as well with some help however I was hacked and someone changed my picture to Donald trump and called my name Josh not D boss! I have now changed my password and my accout and name so hopefully it won't happen again!
