**IT blog 1**

In today's lesson we began by being asked to draw a square the first suggestion was to turn 90* and go forwards, 90* and go forwards etcâ€¦ this ended up not forming a square but a shape turning in random directions with random length sides. We were then told you must firstly specify the direction e.g 90* clockwise or anti-clockwise  or in our terms 90* left or right and then the length e.g two hundred units. We were then told to create a square a pentagon and a triangle on the same horizontal line we used; turtle.forward(...) to move forward and turtle.rotate(...) to turn. We added such commands as width (...) to make the line with larger and Turtle.penup() to make the line stop following the arrow and turtle pen.down() to make the line follow the arrow again. 

I believe I did well in the lesson, after discovering how to change the lines, color and got to work with very little help, I did most of it on my own. This is an improvement as last lessons I almost always needed to ask for lots of help and this time did not rely others to work.
