    <td>In the lesson I learned by noting down lots of facts etc…I learned from reading the manual about the fuse boxes motherboard. The little board contains the CPU(Central Processing Unit) , RAM (Random Access Memory), storage memory, USB sockets and a whole lot more… I also learned that you can type in any phrase not just hello world into the bar so Adam typed in his name and as It scrolled across the mass of 'Adam ********' and it looked a bit like an American football!I also took notes which worked and was effective!

    <td>nextime we should act quicker. This limited my learning because when we didn't act fast enough we ended up not having a power supply. However it then turned out that someone had taken 2! But therwould have been power supply anyway if I was quicker. I also need to Remember my USB stick! Read the book of instructions more carefully because we spent time trying to work things out when we missed bits out.</td>
