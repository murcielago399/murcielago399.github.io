In this lesson we wrote our initials, one of the hardest things was creating the circle in the "J" and then as it was in bible writing doubling it over. One of the ways I created the circle was by turn left the move a certain amount e.g

1. Turtle.forward(15)

2. Turtle.right(10)

I would then copy this repeatedly and would create a circle I then moved onto a "H" which I put inside the “J”. The H was easy as there was not curved edges. I added to my design by changing the color for only the “H” (Turtle.color(“red”)) and I changed the thickness of the line (Turtle.width(15)).

EBI: learn how to make circle without copying same text hundreds of times.
