Revenge porn

In the lesson we were asked to look at an article on revenge porn I didn't know what revenge porn was but after looking at what it is I now know what it is. Revenge porn is the art of sending people pornography/ sexual content to get them in trouble of holding possession of this. Children as young as 11 are among the thousands of alleged victims. This law was introduced in April 2015. There were 1,160 reported incidents of revenge pornography from April 2015 to December 2015.
