This lesson we got our spreadsheet up to date with where we were at. For me that meant sorting my Sub total out we also had to add a sheet named costs and create a list of possible costs, not only this but we also had to create two new sheets named sales and profit and loss. 

Our cover teacher helped me in creating a list of possible costs. I was told to group them into larger categories e.g toilet roll - maintenance or cleaning. I Ended up with about 10 different costs these were;

* Staff costs

* Rent

* Office supplies

* Trackers for my cars

* Minor repairs

* Premici-se maintainers

* Delivery

* Fuel costs

* Import

* Vehicle costs

I also valuated all the costs and gave an estimate on how much I believed they would cost either monthly or yearly e.g rent monthly and vehicle costs yearly. I sorted my sub total by =SUM(E5:E9) this means calculate (=SUM) and then from E5 (the top corner) and E9 (the bottom corner).

Next time I will get all the lessons work done in the lesson and will remember to keep the groups into larger groups not just lots of very small groups. I will spend less time estimating my costs and more time on the code.
