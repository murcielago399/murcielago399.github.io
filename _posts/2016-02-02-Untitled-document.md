The internet can be a great place to chat and share with friends or family members that you may or may see other wise However it can also be a place of dislike and hatred to people and what they do or post. The internet can be a place of laughter and fun but also a dark place of dislike and trolling. If you don't know what trolling is it’s basically leaving mean and hurtful comments to people just for fun long story short it’s a very bad thing to do so DON’T DO IT!

People can be influenced by other people's choices to be popular or 'cool’ .
