    <td>in the lesson I learned the difference between a good looking blog and not so good looking blog a good looking blog and a 5/9 needs to use a variety of techniques, needs to look good and have a good color scheme and needs to reflect upon learning and use good language unlike a not so good blog I got a 4/9 which I would've preferred a 5/9.

    <td>I spent a while trying to get onto the computer as it kept asking me to spell out the word as

This limited my learning as I could not get as much notes down as I would have liked!
