Today we learned about Cryptography, cryptography is '**the art of writing and solving codes'**. we begun by looking at its different uses, these included;

* Sending messages

* Entering passwords 

* Personal information 

We then learned about how we can make our blogs better e.g add more descriptive titles that tell what the lessons about even before reading it e.g the supercomputers blog (like this one). I could also resize the IFrame to show my google sheets larger and spread over the page I am not sure how to do this yet but will look into it.

Carry on with the cryptography we looked at the Cesar syfa code where the code goes in order after the original values by any amount.

E.g 1=X

2=Y

3=A

4=B

5=C

6=D

7=E

The numbers are the original values and the letters are the code and as you can see the code goes in alphabetical order but starts at 'A' later on.

Next time I will resize my IFrame so it fits the border
