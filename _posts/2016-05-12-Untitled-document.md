In the lesson we did lots of tutorials to get to grips with the java script programing method. I learned that there is 4 difficulty settings at the moment i am working on the bottom section which is a bit like scratch however as you can see that the codeing below is not like scratch this is the hardest setting number 4 it is like computer programming and is difficult to use.

Mr Keen explained to us that the max brightness is 225.  

// When the BBC micro:bit runs.

function onStart(  ) {

 globals.readyForNewGame = true;

 

}

function onShake(  ) {

 if (false) {

  

  microbit.say(false);

  

 }

 

 microbit.say(globals.myString);

 microbit.clear();

 wait(Random.number(5000, 10000));

 microbit.draw(Pattern("11111.11111.11111.11111.11111"));

 

}
