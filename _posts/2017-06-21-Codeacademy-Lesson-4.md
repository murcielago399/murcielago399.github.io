Codecademy Lesson 4

In Today's lesson I used Monty Python but only got a few exercises done but not many this was partly due to my teacher informing us about our blogs - like this but not only that but it took me very long amounts of time to do a question so I only got 3 or 4 questions done!

I did do some things well and learn lots mainly e.g I learned how to create variables to a further extent I also learned more about my blog and how to improve it as my teacher critiqued each individual blog and told them what they could work on.

There were many mistakes I made today with time being one of them because I took a very long time to do a little amount and it was all due down to a silly mistake in my code e.g 

Out of the string Make : equil =

"Minute: hour: day"

And instead something like "minute:= hour:= day"

This cost me lots of time and resulted as I have said in little work being completed.

Next time I will read the question more carefully and this will hopefully mean that I will work faster and get more work done. I will keep trying to fix the problem with my blog as apparently there is something wrong with line 260 style.SCSS and will go to IT club to resulted the problem. 

I will keep extending my knowledge further on Monty Python and Variables.
