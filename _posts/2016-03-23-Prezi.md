**Prezi**

Prezi is a presentation help tool that unlike Microsoft Word and Google Docs you can zoom in and zoom out vast amounts like opening lots of doors for instance you have picture of a boy on a laptop with a sticker on the laptop and you wouldn't notice with the naked eye that there is something inside it but when you do zoom in on the sticker you then uncover a whole new world inside it. 

In the lesson Mr Keen showed us it and told us that it is not a presentation but it is a presentation tool because you are the presenter manipulating the tool. The worst presenters make lists of what the subject is and some just write down exactly what they are going to say so when they read it to you it is boring and you could read it yourself. On the other hand good presenters use the software as prompts for what they are going to say, so you need them to tell you the detail about the subject.
