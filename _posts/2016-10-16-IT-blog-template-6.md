    <td>today we got cracking on with the work  we were like lightning. I had almost no time to write this in the lesson! I think we work at a better rate if I read off the work book and take notes about what we did well and not so well (this), and if Adam types this could be because he's a fast typer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>in the lesson I told Adam a few wrong words this made us waste some time trying to figure the simple problem out. Other things that have limited my learning were the time wasting this is because i stood waiting for ages for question about graph paper but in the end it turned out that all i needed to do was to do it in my head . i could have worked all this out and saved lots of time also i could have just done the design in my planner. This time wasting stopped me from not getting very far!</td>
