TROLLING

In the lesson we talked about good and bad rules for the internet things like

O Don't feed the trolls which basically means don’t respond because trolls only troll to be       blocked and when they do they feel that they have achieved their mission to annoy you

O DON'T TROLL!

If you are wondering what trolling is it's bassically leaving bad comments for your enjoyment like die and other terrible things like that. However don’t get bogged down by them everyone will get them at some point if you use social media it is not unusual to be sent them. Sometimes they can be upsetting and hurtful or even racist and offensive!

The internet can be a useful aswell it's not all bad you can communicate with friends and family you would not see otherwise and you can arrange dates to meet up quickly for instance if you want your friend bob to come round on saturday and it’s sunday the only quick way to do it is to use social media and using letters you have to find their address and buy a pack of stamps which all takes a while. whereas text you can quickly get their number and text them in a minute
