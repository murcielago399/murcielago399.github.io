IT Blogpost 12 :            microbit game

If there was one thing that I would have liked to done better in the lesson (con) it would be efficiency for instance... I spent more of the lesson trying to regather my work from google docs than on coding. Because every time I tried to copy and paste or fixe a line then something else would happen. I also need to check my google classroom more often as I did not realise that we had to show Mr Keen our blog website. Unfortunately I've not reached the target of fifteen blog posts however I will post some more as I forgot to post some of them and one is on microsoft word .I had to do this as there was a problem with the my website and google docs so I will post them hopefully tonight. 

Don't worry though the lesson wasn’t all bad though I don’t mean a bad lesson, I just mean that lots of things didn’t go as I had intended. I had a stroke of genius in the lesson when me and adam couldn’t get the game to know that when the dot is touched it should restart the game. However I then realised that worst snake ever has that same feature with the golden apple so I tweaked it slightly and 'voala’ I think that it’s worked.
