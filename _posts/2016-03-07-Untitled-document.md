In the lesson we learned about a website named / called CEOP IT's about helping children / teenagers who have made a mistake it can be an illegal mistake like taking child pornography . . . etc and it helps them to realize why what theyâ€™ve done is wrong and help them to get over the mistake not keep worrying about it. Also the mistake can lead to being bullied sibar , mentally you name it ,it can help and make you feel better about your mistake that you may have made.

or it can also help just to stop you from a making silly mistake in your life and it can help if you eventually do make a mistake 

the website has a running video where you see a short clip of a video and then you have to choose what to do next and if you make the right decisions you will end up with good consequences however if you make the wrong decision it will end up badly and by the end it shows what they do in the future.

I think that you should have a look at this website because it is very helpful about online safety and online bullying also (purvets,sexbenders and pedofiles) who are all people who break the law and are very bad and break the law for sexual reasosns only
