Blog (microbit)

In the lesson we learned about a memory chip that millions of kids all round the country will receive like me we will revive them this term hopefully because they are already very late

You use the microchip by going on the computer and creating a computer code on a website there are several way of programing such as; Java script, Microsoft block editor, python and many more in the Java script method you have an option like draw [pattern] and then you would add a pattern and it would flash that pattern or with the block editor it is a bit like scratch you can also create games on the programme and play them on the micro chip

I think this microchip is a great way to get children to code all around the country and who knows maybe because of this chip a revolutionary invention that could change the world could be invented!
