    <td>This week both of us brought memory sticks unlike last week when it was just me and my partner who forgot and the week before when we both forgot one. This week we worked efficiently together, with my partner on the fuse box typing commands and various codes and me on the workbook, reading out instructions and noting down things. Like last week I took notes of the lesson thus making homework much, much easier.</td>

    <td>this week someone tried to rip the back off one of the fuse boxes this may have not limited my learning but it certainly limited someone else's - not having a fuse box. Luckily unlike two weeks ago I or should i say we managed to get one just in time. In the lesson I wasn't feeling great so I wasn't quite as sharp. My partner forgot to save the work or did however it deleted it for some reason...</td>
