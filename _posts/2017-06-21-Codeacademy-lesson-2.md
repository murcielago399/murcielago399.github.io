Codecademy  lesson 2

Today was the 2nd day of Codecademy and as I forgot to remember my password I spend around ½ the lesson trying to login not necessary because i forgot it but it wouldn't work so after shutting down the computer several times it still wouldn’t work so i had to say i forgot my  password and then change it via my email which was hassle and took most of the lesson.  

Because i spent ages trying to get the passwords to work i did little work earning only 1 badge. Next time i will write my password down in order to not forget it and not to waste time. This lesson i also struggled to set variables as i thought that you needed a command before it e.g print. So over the lesson I extended my knowledge and now can easily use variables.
