Today in IT we began by looking at variables in the python turtle coding method. We first started by asking the candidates name to do this we used the variables, the code looked like this

My_name = input 

 Print ("what's your name")

 ("What are your favorite sports “ + My_name + )

We used  "_____ = input ()" to create the variables. I created that asked about what your favourite sport is I gave the reader a series of sports they could choose one I used.

We had to put colons ':'after the words; else, if and elif, I was told that you should not use more than one ‘if’ in the same question. I also discovered that you can use ‘or’ to add to the amount of sports being used in one answer e.g 

elif favourite sport == ("cricket" or “rugby”):  Print (“I like that as well”)

I used Else to answer for when they did choose one of the options, like this;

Else:

  Print (" that's not the answer I was looking for")
