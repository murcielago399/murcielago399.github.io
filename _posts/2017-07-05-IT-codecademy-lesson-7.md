Today I was using booleans booleans are a question that has an answer showing on screen depending on the answers so if the reader answers a question incorrectly then they will get a different answer than if they answered correctly as shown below.</td>

    <td>I may have passed through the tutorials but I was still struggling as I am still struggling to create variables and remember all the function types e.g Variables, Booleans etc... I still need to work faster and stop getting help from others as I am regularly stuck and require help often. </td>

    <td>next time I will research more on variables and how to create them hopefully this will help and allow me to work faster without the assistance of others. I will also keep improving my blog to get it up to standard as it is currently not.</td>
