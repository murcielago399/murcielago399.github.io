    <td>this week I learned how much I can do with GitHub such as… Creating borders, making the background picture/ image visible from the blog and even how to make round edges around the posts that I put up.another thing that helped my learning is when me and my partner last lesson moved ahead and skipped a bit to try and get some of the harder bits done so this lesson we came to the bit that we skipped and get it done quickly and efficiently.</td>

    <td>I still have forgotten to put my work into a blog which is a bit silly of me however I'm going to do it by Friday though or I'll get a detention. I forgot to use google before asking how to make the background fit the whole screen. One thing that limited my learning was the super short lesson I think from what I remember that the lesson was only forty five minutes long as oppose to an hour, so I lost fifteen minutes! This may have not been in my control 
But it still limited my learning. My github editing mechanism won't work because every time i try to edit it doesn't allow me to paste and delete code so i cannot change very much i spent at least 1hour trying to only change the colors of the image to black and white and i couldn’t even insert a different image! So here is all i got.

img {
	-webkit-filter: blur(5px); /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
	filter: blur(5px);
}
