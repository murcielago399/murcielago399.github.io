    <td>This lesson i continued with python and worked next to someone who was on the same questions as me this helped as when we got stuck we could asked each other for help. This made us a team and completed more exercises. I got cracking on with the work right away. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I got stuck like usually for long amounts of time on questions - like usual. This caused time loss as we could both not figure out the issue in our code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will be more proactive with my learning and ask for help when in need of it. This should help me be faster so i can get onto the next tasks. This will also help my learning as the teacher can explain where i went wrong and tell me what to do next time unlike if i don't ask i could just get it ny luck not really knowing how it was done and not benefiting my learning!</td>
