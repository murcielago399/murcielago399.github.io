In the lesson we talked about revenge pornography. I may have talked about this in my last blog post so I'll change the subject in the lesson I also learned about sexting.

 

We discussed what it was in sexting someone sends a sexual image or comment to someone else we also learned what to do if this situation occurs so here it goes step 1; close your device Don't delete the image or message as it could be used for evidence or look at it for 20mins as itâ€™ll be like handing yourself in. nor send it to someone else (Mr Keen). Step 2 tell your parents or teacher and then your on your way.
