Today we continued  with Cryptography on google sheets using the shift cipher code we learned about the left formula and the right formula we also learned about a more complex and harder to guess code within the shift cipher code. This more complex code worked like thisâ€¦ think of a word where no letter repeats itself e.g cake you would then add this like this;

C

A

K

E

And then you would carry on the alphabet normally however you would not repeat the letters C, A, K, E so the alphabet would go; A, B, D, F, G etc.this means there is harder to guess the code as the first letters can be any length and possible combination of letters even like; super,Cala,fragilistic,expi,ala,docious! We also learned about the Left & right e.g right formula which are when you write a word like hello and it then goes Hello, Hell, Hel, He, H.

This lesson I struggled to keep with time as I didn't know some shortcuts that could save time e.g the shortcut that allows you to carry a sequence on so you only need to write the first four letters in the sequence to repeat it as high as it can go. You could write 1, 2, 3, 4 and it would go up like this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 etc. This wasted a lot of time as I had to do this 3 times up to 21 and I missed out on lesson time due to my lack of knowledge. 

Next time I will look at short cuts so I don't waste time in the lessons.
