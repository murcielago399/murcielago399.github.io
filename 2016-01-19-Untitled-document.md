murcielago399s first blog post

In the lesson we learned about E safety and how little infomation you should give away about your self. For instance, you find  picture on the internet of a girl at a party at her school so you then know about her and what school she goes to and ten you can access the school database and know her parents names. Then you can also know where se lives and work out a route they go and kidnap her.

And we also learned that you can aim aults children so they nag growns up to buy it.
